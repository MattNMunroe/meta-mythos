# INTRODUCTION

The history of humanity is one rife with creativity (amongst other things). Natural phenomenon were observed around us, and before there was the technology to explain it, people simply had their five senses and the Void of Mind to help them put the pieces together.
This lead to an explation of 'Neteru' or 'Nature' using grandiose and exquiste imagery of gods and creatures alike. From Anansi to Ziz, Meta-Mythos is a hub for those looking to learn more about our web of consciousness through studying the ideas of the past, while simultaneously giving the user a vast worldy knowledge of mythic creatures and figures, which is sure to make you the life of any party! 
Delve into the Myth, today!
