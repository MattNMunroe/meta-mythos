            <h3>Just what is the "Occult"? What's it mean, and stand for?</h3>
            <p>This word, when heard by many, strikes a sort of metaphysical fear into their spiritual well-beings. Being associated with things such as the "Evil Eye", Voodoo, Bruerja, and many other "darker" practices, people tend to stray away from the wealth of knowledge tucked away in these traditions.</p>
            <p>"Occult" simply means "Hidden". Elements of psychology and mysticism that have been used to explain natural phenomenon since the earliest periods of humanity. There's nothing inherently "evil" about it. With the right eye, it can be seen as a well of creativity and history. Commonalities also begin to present themselves in the everyday aspects of our world! The word "Horizon" or comes from Horus {"(Horus-Zone)"}, the Egyptian Sun God, for instance.</p>
            <break></break>
            <h3>So how can this Mythos help expel any fears?</h3>
            <p>A great man once said, "One who knows nothing, can understand nothing." - Ansem, Seeker of Darkness.</p>
            <p>It is natural to have tredpidations to the things one's been told to stay away from. But without knowing the stressor, without understanding it, why exactly do you fear it then? Hearsay? We all know to talk it is one thing, but to live and understand it is another. The creatures, personas, locations, and history of each entry of the Mythos will help illustrate not only commonalities between the cultures of man, but a new an expansive way of thinking about the world presented to you.</p>
            <break></break>
            <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
            <p>Quelling the fears built by years of deceit and secrecy lead to unbridled amounts of creativity and power. An understanding of the Occult, or more so, an understanding of the hidden powers of the mind, can lead to a life of fulfillment and exploration. You become impervious to mental manipulations and psychological warfare, all while radiating excellence and warmth. It is a power that if all humans knew of, respected, and tapped into, would amount to a world of difference for us all.</p>
